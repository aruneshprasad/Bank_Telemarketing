# Bank_Telemarketing
This repository primarily contains a data set of an European bank which wishes to understand which of its customers are likely to respond to a phone marketing offer to set up a term deposit. This project aims at applying different analytical methods to help the bank understand what factors could be the deciding factors for a customer to say yes to a long term deposit offer. 

Background: An European bank wishes to understand which of its customers are likely to respond to a phone marketing offer to set up a long-term deposit. 
1. Analyzed the data set. Did basic data exploration in SAS and Excel. Univariate and Bivariate analysis to determine the correlation between certain variables. Visualized the data to understand the significance of variables.
2. Prepared the data for modeling. Transforming data, creating interactive and dummy variables as well as removing outliers.
3. Ran Binary Logistic Regression to build a model to understand the predictor variables and answer question which would be necessary to predict the response of the customers. 
4. Finalized and validated the model on the validation data set. Checked the accuracy of the model using Gain chart, ROC curve and confusion matrix.
