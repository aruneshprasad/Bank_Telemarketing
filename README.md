# Bank_Telemarketing
This repository primarily contains a data set of an European bank which wishes to understand which of its customers are likely to respond to a phone marketing offer to set up a term deposit. This project aims at applying different analytical methods to help the bank understand what factors could be the deciding factors for a customer to say yes to a long term deposit offer.
